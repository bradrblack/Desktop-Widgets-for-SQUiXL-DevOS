# Desktop Gadgets for SQUiXL

This is a fork of the Unexpected Maker SQUiXL project with four new full-screen widget panels:
* Clock - with WiFi and Battery Status plus a play/pause control for auto-rotation of widgets
* Markets - up to six stock/index/currency symbols from Yahoo Finance
* Weather - OpenWeather forecast
* Calendar - Next six events in your Google Calendar
* OTA progress bar - shows status during OTA firmware updates

# SQUiXL Official Shipping Firmware V2

This is a new firmware revision with breaking API changes from firmware version 1.  [Firmware version 1](https://github.com/UnexpectedMaker/SQUiXL-DevOS/tree/firmware_v1) is still available if you want to keep using that, but if you have forked this project and added custom functionality, please see the firmware upgrade doc in the `/docs` folder.

Hey, congratulations, you got yourself a SQUiXL!

This repository includes the (totally in development, forever to be evolving) full source for the included shipping firmware, which requires PlatformIO.

The shipping firmware is really a development demo that is used to add and test new features, and to offer those that want to design rich interactive applications a solid starting point that touches every aspect of what you can do with SQUiXL.

Maybe one day it will turn into something more... maybe a full OS of sorts, but for now it's just a fun playground.

# You don't own a SQUiXL?
We should remedy that right away... Head over to https://squixl.io and order yourself one.

## SQUiXL GPIO Table

Below are lists of GPIO used on SQUiXL that iclude native ESP32-S3 IO, IO Expander IO and IOMUX IO.

I've also included the IO used for the ESP32-S3 RGB LCD Peripheral that drives the screen, and these IO *SHOULD NOT BE TOUCHED* or the screen will not oppperate.
